## Last Week's Accomplishments

 - Made it so translating an object un-straightens any wires connecting it to anchored objects

## This Week's Plan

 - Fix wire snapping bugs
   - Extend the wire-unstraightening to the rotation tool
     - Maybe I need to move some code around to make this cleaner?
   - Incapable of snapping in X and Y dimensions at the same time
   - Incapable of straightening both adjacent wires at the same time

## Anything Blocking?

 - No
