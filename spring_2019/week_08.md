## Last Week's Accomplishments

 - Simple wire snapping
   - When a wire port is dragged near the X or Y coordinates of a port it connects to, the port jumps to that X or Y coordinate respectively and straightens the wire connecting the two ports.

## This Week's Plan

 - Make it so translating an object un-straightens any wires connecting it to anchored objects

## Anything Blocking?

 - No
