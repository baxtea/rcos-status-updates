## Last Week's Accomplishments

Got a working build of the project
Got my GitHub permissions fixed, submitted linux build instructions to the wiki
Met some people on the team
Began porting the selection properties popup menu to TypeScript
Assembled a list of usability quirks and feature requests

## This Week's Plan

Continue porting the selection properties popup menu to TypeScript
 - Go back to psoft notes to search for applicable design patterns
 - Look into reflection/descriptors as a possible way to implement this cleanly

Become more familiar with DOM manipulation in TypeScript (as opposed to my background in mostly WebGL)

## Anything Blocking?

General unfamiliarity with the code base and how to interact with it
 - Especially difficult with differing code styles from different times/people
Knowledge of TypeScript is fairly superficial
