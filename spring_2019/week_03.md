## Last Week's Accomplishments

Fixed the selection properties popup
 - Positioned properly in screen space
 - Pushes and pulls names and positions to/from selected components

## This Week's Plan

 - Implement color and input port count modules in the TS branch
 - Add an output port count module for certain gates
 - Make a pull request to get this in master
 - Experiment with more extensible ways to determine which modules to activate
   - Something like `getPopupProperties()` overridden per-class?
   - Would be cleaner but potentially not worth the time investment...

## Anything Blocking?

 - Lots of upcoming due dates in other courses
